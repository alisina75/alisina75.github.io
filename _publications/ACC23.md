Industrial1 drying processes play a pivotal role in manufacturing, accounting for a substantial 12% of total energy consumption. The complexity arises from the need to optimize the sequence of distinct drying technologies to ensure energy efficiency while maintaining product quality. This challenge translates into a combinatorial optimization problem with a vast number of valid sequences and discrete variables. To tackle this intricate issue, our research introduces a novel approach based on the Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP), a powerful concept from statistical mechanics and information theory. The MEP is harnessed to model and optimize the sub-processes within an industrial drying unit. This principle enables us to assign a probability distribution to all potential configurations, guiding the optimization process. What sets this methodology apart is its utilization of a homotopy approach from an auxiliary function to the original non-convex cost function. This iterative procedure circumvents the complexities of local minima, resulting in the convergence of the auxiliary function to the desired non-convex cost function. This innovative approach, underpinned by the MEP, not only transforms the industrial drying landscape but also holds the potential to revolutionize similar optimization challenges across diverse industrial domains.
