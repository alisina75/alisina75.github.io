<h1>WiFi Mesh Network Routing Optimization</h1>

<p>This project advances WiFi mesh network routing optimization through a novel three-case study, resulting in a deep learning-based digital twin. Initially, we explore single-band and multi-channel configurations, then advance to dual-band routers, addressing complex network dynamics. To overcome the slow interaction between optimization algorithms and the simulation environment, we transform the Simulink MATLAB simulation into a digital twin. By incorporating known system symmetries and properties, we facilitate the learning process, making this twin an integral part of our optimization algorithm for enhanced network performance and efficiency.</p>
